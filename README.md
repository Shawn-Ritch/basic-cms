# basic-cms Version1.0.1
Finally! I have re-developed this basic CMS to be WAY more developer friendly and modifiable.

Benefits for using a CMS like this:
1) Desined and developed specifically for developers / programmers.
2) Super light weight, the entire system is now only 37kb!
3) Is SEO friendly with clean URLs and some meta tags already incuded.
4) Loads within .3 seconds - tested @ https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.webdeveloprz.com%2F&tab=desktop
5) Includes a simple front-end, HTML & CSS I have given you to start with.
6) Also includes five pages to get you started.
7) Easy to navigate files and folders for modification.
8) Almost completely commented out so you can see how it all works.
9) Has some security in place to get you started.

I hope you use and enjoy working with this. It has taken me quite some time to develop this in such a comprehensive way so most developers would be able to use it with ease. 

You can view the working product here: https://cms.webdeveloprz.com/

My hope is that the good people in the development community will help make it even better.
Please feel free to add / request changes to inprove this for the masses ;)

And always - Enjoy :)
